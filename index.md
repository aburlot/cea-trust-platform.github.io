# TRUST - The CEA's open source HPC platform

TRUST is a thermohydraulic software package for CFD simulations. It was originally designed for incompressible single-phase and Low Mach Number flows, but now also allows simulating real compressible multi-phase flows. TRUST is also being progressively ported to support GPU acceleration (NVidia/AMD).

This software is **OpenSource ([BSD license](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code/blob/master/License.txt))**.
