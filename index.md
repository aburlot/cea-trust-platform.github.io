# TRUST - The CEA's open source HPC platform

TRUST is a High Performance Computing (HPC) thermohydraulic engine for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) developped at the Departement of System and Structure Modelisation (DM2S) of the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).

The acronym **TRUST** stands for **TR**io**U** **S**oftware for **T**hermohydraulics. This software was originally designed for conduction, incompressible single-phase, and Low Mach Number (LMN) flows with a robust Weakly-Compressible (WC) multi-species solver. 

However, a huge effort has been conducted recently, and now TRUST is able to simulate real compressible multi-phase flows. 

TRUST is also being progressively ported to support GPU acceleration (NVidia/AMD).

This software is OpenSource (**[BSD license](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code/blob/master/License.txt)**), available **[here](https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code)** on GitHub.
