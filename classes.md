# What it contains ?

TRUST is a powerful and robust HPC CFD software. The code consits of a huge Kernel (about 50% of the sources) with a wide implementation of problems (equations), numerical models, discretizations, schemes and solvers. 

Have a look on the main TRUST classes in what follows. This can help you in defining your application and in setting up your simulation ! In order to check all the available classes, you are invited to visit the TRUST Doxygen documentation which is available **[here](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/TRUST_Doxygen.github.io/html/index.html)**.
