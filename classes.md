# What it contains ?

TRUST is a powerful and robust HPC CFD software. The code consists of a huge Kernel (about 50% of the sources) with a wide implementation of problems (equations), numerical models, discretizations, schemes and solvers. 

TRUST allows basically 2D and 3D simulations on almost all types of meshes. Several discretizations (see later in the Discretizations section) allow performing 2D axi-symmetrical simulations. Similarly, 1D cases are possible if a dedicated discretization is used.

Have a look at the most important TRUST classes in what follows. This can help you in defining your application and in setting up your simulation!

If you are interested in checking all classes available in the platform, you can check the TRUST Doxygen documentation which is available **[here](https://cea-trust-platform.github.io/TRUST_Doxygen.github.io/html/index.html)**.
